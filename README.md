## Mission

The Fentanyl Awareness Coalition (FAC) is founded by bereaved families who have lost loved ones to the fentanyl epidemic. Our energies are directed toward the following goals: 

- We advocate for the reduction and restriction of illicit Synthetic Analogues in the United States; 

- We endeavor to raise awareness about the new and unique risks – to all segments of our society – resulting from the sudden influx of illicit Synthetic drugs into the United States;

- We will accomplish this through our affiliation with member organizations throughout the United States.
